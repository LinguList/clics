  month = {Jan},
  pages = {1118--1123},
  abstract = {To comprehend the multipartite organization of large-scale biological
	and social systems, we introduce an information theoretic approach
	that reveals community structure in weighted and directed networks.
	We use the probability flow of random walks on a network as a proxy
	for information flows in the real system and decompose the network
	into modules by compressing a description of the probability flow.
	The result is a map that both simplifies and highlights the regularities
	in the structure and their relationships. We illustrate the method
	by making a map of scientific communication as captured in the citation
	patterns of >6,000 journals. We discover a multicentric organization
	with fields that vary dramatically in size and degree of integration
	into the network of science. Along the backbone of the network-including
	physics, chemistry, molecular biology, and medicine-information flows
	bidirectionally, but the map reveals a directional pattern of citation
	from the applied fields to the basic sciences.},
