@article{Lancichinetti2009,
	Abstract = {Uncovering the community structure exhibited by real networks is a
	crucial step toward an understanding of complex systems that goes
	beyond the local organization of their constituents. Many algorithms
	have been proposed so far, but none of them has been subjected to
	strict tests to evaluate their performance. Most of the sporadic
	tests performed so far involved small networks with known community
	structure and/or artificial graphs with a simplified structure, which
	is very uncommon in real systems. Here we test several methods against
	a recently introduced class of benchmark graphs, with heterogeneous
	distributions of degree and community size. The methods are also
	tested against the benchmark by Girvan and Newman [Proc. Natl. Acad.
	Sci. U.S.A. 99, 7821 (2002)] and on random graphs. As a result of
	our analysis, three recent algorithms introduced by Rosvall and Bergstrom
	[Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 104, 7327 (2007); Proc. Natl. Acad.
	Sci. U.S.A. 105, 1118 (2008)], Blondel [J. Stat. Mech.: Theory Exp.
	(2008), P10008], and Ronhovde and Nussinov [Phys. Rev. E 80, 016109
	(2009)] have an excellent performance, with the additional advantage
	of low computational complexity, which enables one to analyze large
	systems.},

@article{Rosvall2008,
	Abstract = {To comprehend the multipartite organization of large-scale biological
	and social systems, we introduce an information theoretic approach
	that reveals community structure in weighted and directed networks.
	We use the probability flow of random walks on a network as a proxy
	for information flows in the real system and decompose the network
	into modules by compressing a description of the probability flow.
	The result is a map that both simplifies and highlights the regularities
	in the structure and their relationships. We illustrate the method
	by making a map of scientific communication as captured in the citation
	patterns of >6,000 journals. We discover a multicentric organization
	with fields that vary dramatically in size and degree of integration
	into the network of science. Along the backbone of the network-including
	physics, chemistry, molecular biology, and medicine-information flows
	bidirectionally, but the map reveals a directional pattern of citation
	from the applied fields to the basic sciences.},
