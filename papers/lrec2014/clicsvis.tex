\abstract{
In this paper, we present an interactive web-based visualization for the CLiCS database, an online
resource for synchronic lexical associations (\emph{polysemies}, or more precisely, \emph{colexifications})
in over 200 language varieties. The associations cover
1285 concepts and represent the tendency for concepts to be expressed by the same words in
the same language varieties of the world. 
The complexity of the network structure in the CLiCS database calls for
a visualization component that makes it easier for researchers to explore the patterns of
cross-linguistic colexifications. The network is represented as a force-directed graph and features a
number of interactive components that allow the user to get an overview of the overall structure
while at the same time providing the opportunity to look into the data in more detail. An integral
part of the visualization is an interactive listing of all languages that contribute to the strength
of the cross-linguistic colexifications. Each language in the list is thereby attributed a different
color depending on its genealogical or areal information. In this way, given associations can be
inspected for genealogical or areal bias.

\section{Introduction}
% stress the importance of the visualization as added value to the resource; what can be seen with the visualization that would be otherwise hard to notice

What does ``good'' have to do with ``beautiful''? Logically, not everything that is good is beautiful, and not everything that is beautiful is good. However, people seem to associate these concepts quite strongly, as linguistic data suggest: ``good'' and ``beautiful'' are expressed by identical word forms in at least 27 languages from 8 different language families. To assess the cognitive, linguistic, and cultural implications of this fact correctly, additional information would be useful: Where are these languages located on the globe? How are they distributed amoung the 8 families? Which other concepts are verbalized by the same form as ``good'' and ``beautiful''?

Synchronnic lexical association or \textsl{colexification}, i.e.~the verbalization of two or more concepts by means of the same form in a given language, is an important source of information for investigations in cognitive linguistics, linguistic typology, and historical semantics. In this paper, we present an interactive web-based visualization for CLiCs, an online database that contains a large crosslinguistic data set on colexifications worldwide. We provide a brief outline of CLiCs, describe the functionalities of the visualization, and show that the visualization is an indispensible tool that enables researches to take an overview of the data and concisely plan further quantitative analyses according to their needs.
