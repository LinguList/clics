CLiCs (\emph{\textbf{C}ross-\textbf{Li}nguistic \textbf{C}olexification\textbf{s}},
\url{http://clics.lingpy.org}) is an online database of synchronic lexico-semantic associations
in 215 languages and language varieties of the world. CLiCs exploits already existing large online
lexical databases, but has the advantage that it makes visible the relationships between meanings
and forms in the object languages, something which is not easily possible using the interfaces of its
sources themselves. Table \ref{tab:clics} gives an example on the basic structure of the data in CLiCs.

\subsection{Homonymy, polysemy, and colexification}
%CLiCs can help to identify regularities in semantic
%change and conceptual associations. Innovative semantic change consists in the acquisition of a new
%meaning $n$ by a given word $w$, which has one or more original meanings $o_{i}, i \in \mathbb{N}$.
%The new meaning $n$ is associated in some way -- for example metaphorically or metonymically -- to
%$o_k$, one of the original meanings of $w$ \cite{blank1997}. As a consequence, $w$ carries
%-- at least for a certain time -- both meanings $n$ and $o$, between which there is a conceptual
%relation. This is referred to as \emph{polysemy (of $w$)}. Conversely, historical linguists
%conclude abductively from the polysemy of $w$ that one of the meanings of $w$ is likely to have
%emerged on the basis of the other. Therefore, polysemy can be used to reconstruct and analyze
%semantic change \cite{traugottdasher2002}.
A well-known concept from lexical semantic analysis is that of \emph{polysemy}. It refers to the situation
in which a lexical item possesses more than one identifiable sense between which there is a
conceptual relation. A number of tests are available to distinguish polysemy from \emph{semantic
vagueness}, in which a division into distinct senses is not warranted. From an analytical perspective
polysemy has to be further distinguished from {homonymy} and contextual variation.
\emph{Homonymy} refers to
the "accidental" verbalization of at least two meanings by the same sound chain, without any
conceptual relation that is more than coincidental. \emph{Contextual variation}
designates the adaption of a lexicalized meaning to contextual factors in an utterance. Although
historical and synchronic criteria have been proposed to distinguish polysemy from homonymy, and
contextual variation can be tested by resorting to categorization \cite{blank1997}, the
differentiation depends on the individual analysis of every single word and is not entirely
objective. Hence, it is difficult for quantitative investigations to provide this differentiation
in advance.
Here, we use the term \textit{colexification} (originally from \newcite{francois2008})
%\nocite{francois2008}
to refer to the situation
in which two or more of the meanings in our sources correspond to the same lexical item in one of
the languages. For instance, we would say that Wayuu [guc] colexifies ``good'' and ``beautiful'' by means of the word form \textit{anas\textbari}.\footnote{See also the example of ``money'' and ``silver'' in the case study in Section \ref{case study} below.}
Colexification is thus a deliberately ambiguous label that allows us to avoid making a commitment in
each case as to the adequate lexical semantic analysis.
Roughly speaking,
colexification can correspond either to polysemy or contextual variation in lexical semantic analyses.
Since CLiCs is not based on such analyses that would allow us to further discriminate between the
two, we chose colexification as a label that deliberately does not make a commitment with regard to
this distinction. However, as we will show below, quantitative approaches are available to rule out effects of accidental homonymy. 
%To take account of the difficulty of distinguishing neatly between cases of contextual variation,
%polysemy, and homonymy, we stick to the term \emph{colexification} \cite{francois2008} as referring
%to any situation in which several meanings are \emph{colexified} by the same sound chain. 
%This
%terminological convention has additional advantages: 1) Whereas polysemy describes the property of a
%word, colexification describes the property of a group of concepts and thus fits in much better with
%the onomasiological approach of CLiCs. 2) We avoid unintended implications based on the
%structuralist origin of the term \emph{polysemy} \cite{breal1897} and readily reflect the fact that
%not all synchronic lexical associations in CLiCs are the result of historical change processes.

\subsection{Data and sources of CLiCs}
CLiCs offers information on colexification in 215 different language varieties
covering 50 different language families. All language varieties in our sample comprise a total of
290,760 words covering 1,288 different concepts.\footnote{Since some concepts are expressed by more
than one word in the respective languages, the number of words is higher than the expected one
(276,920) if
multiple synonyms per concept were not allowed.} Using a strictly automatic procedure, we identified
45,282 cases of colexification that correspond to 16,043 different links between the 1,288 concepts
covered by our data. 

At present, three sources feed into CLiCs: (1) The \emph{Intercontinental Dictionary Series} (IDS, Key and
Comrie 2007), offering lexical data for 233 languages and language varieties of the world. Ideally,
datasets for each language contain 1,310 entries, though coverage differs in completeness for
individual languages. Of all 233 languages in IDS, 178 were automatically cleaned and included in
CLiCs. (2) The \emph{World Loanword Database} (WOLD, Haspelmath and Tadmor 2009), the main goal of which
has to do with identifying lexical borrowings, but which nevertheless also provides general lexical
data for 41 languages. The vocabularies for the individual languages differ somewhat in their size,
ranging somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 items. 33 of the 41 vocabularies are included in CLiCs.
(3) Data for four languages neither represented in IDS nor WOLD were added from the \emph{LOGOS} dictionary
(\url{http://www.logosdictionary.org}), a multilingual online dictionary.\footnote{In all cases, we ignored proto-languages and
archaic languages (like Latin and Old Greek), and those languages which
did not have enough coverage in terms of lexical items.}

\subsection{Network modeling of CLiCs}
As mentioned above, there is no guarantee that lexical associations within CLiCs reflect conceptual associations. For example, there are three attested links between the
concepts ``arm" and ``poor" in the current version of CLiCs, which are due to homonymy in some
Germanic languages (German, Dutch, and Yiddish).
 
In order to distinguish strong
association tendencies from
spuriously occurring associations and to rule out cases of accidental homonymy, \newcite{List2013a} model cross-linguistic colexification data as a weighted network
in which nodes represent concepts and weighted edges between the nodes represent the number of
attested colexifications in the data.  With the help of \emph{community detection analyses}, strongly
interconnected regions in the colexification network can be identified. \newcite{List2013a} apply
a weighted version of the community detection algorithm by \newcite{Girvan2002} to a
cross-linguistic colexification network consisting of 1,252 concepts translated into 195 languages
covering 44 language families. Their analysis yielded a total of 337 communities, with 104 communities
consisting of 5 and more nodes and covering 68\% of all concepts. A qualitative survey of the
largest communities showed that most of them constitute meaningful units, and accidental homologies
were successfully excluded.

\subsection{Limitations and Caveats} \label{caveats}

Data structure in CLiCs directly mirrors that in the sources we used. We did not manipulate or
reanalyze the data in any way, to the effect that the reliability of CLiCs largely is a function of
that of its sources. However, we would like to point out that we cannot rule out entirely the
possibility of artifacts arising from automatic data cleaning in cases where textual coding of the
data was inconsistent. As for its actual application, it also must be borne in mind that
CLiCs reflects a certain bias regarding the geographical locations of the languages included in its
sources: IDS features many languages of South America and the Caucasus, while WOLD includes a
disproportionate percentage of languages of Europe. Hence, the sheer frequency of instances of a particular colexification pattern in CLiCs may be misleading insofar as a pattern is very robust
cross-linguistically, but actually is so only in certain regions of the world. We have not
implemented any computational method in CLiCs to balance out the picture \emph{a posteriori}. Since we
nevertheless want to present potential users of CLiCs with the possibility to assess possible areal
patterns in the data, we include a powerful visualization that enables them to detect areal
imbalances in colexification patterns in individual cases themselves.
