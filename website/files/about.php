<h3>What is CliCs?</h3>
<br>
CliCs is an online database of <i>synchronic lexical associations</i>
("polysemies", but more precisely: <i>colexifications</i>) in currently 215 language varieties 
of the world.  Large databases offering lexical information on the worldâ€™s languages are already 
readily available for research in different <a href="faq.php#data1">online sources</a>.  However, the 
information on tendencies of meaning associations available in these databases is not easily 
extractable from the sources themselves. This is why CliCs was created. It is designed to serve as a 
data source for work in lexical typology, diachronic semantics, and research in cognitive science 
that focuses on natural language semantics from the viewpoint of cross-linguistic diversity.  
Furthermore, CliCs can be used as a helpful tool to assess the plausibility of semantic connections 
between possible cognates in the establishment of genetic relations between languages.
