<h3><a style="color:black" name="colexification">Colexification</a></h3>
<br>
In the context of CLiCs, we use the term <i>colexification</i> (coined to our 
knowledge by <a href="http://lingulist.de/evobib/evobib.php?key=Francois2008">François 2008</a>) to refer to the situation when two or more of the meanings 
in our lexical sources are covered in a language by the same lexical item. 
For instance, we would say that 
Russian <i>рука</i> colexifies "hand" and "arm", that is, concepts that are semantically related to each other.
Roughly spoken, colexification can correspond either to polysemy or semantic vagueness in lexical 
semantic analyses. Since we have not performed such analyses that would allow us to further discriminate between the two, 
we chose <i>colexification</i> as a label 
that deliberately does not make a commitment with regard to this distinction.  However, we offer
measures to rule out effects of <a href="faq.php#homonymy">accidental homonymy</a>.
<br><br>
<h3><a style="color:black" name="examples">Using CLiCs</a></h3>
<br>
Using our <a href="query.php">query interface</a> you can search whether specific concepts are 
linked in the language varieties used in CLiCs (see <a href="direct.php">Direct Links</a>). You can 
also check how many links are reported for a given concept (see <a href="all.php">All Links</a>). You 
can also <a href="download.php">download</a> parts of the data and conduct large-scale quantitative 
investigations. As an example on how these analyses can be conducted, see the paper by <a target="_blank" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology-new/W/W13/W13-0208.pdf">List, Terhalle, and Urban (2013)</a>.
<br><br>
<h3><a style="color:black" name="data1">Sources of CLiCs</a></h3>
<br>
Currently CLiCs utilizes three different sources, all of which are freely available online themselves. 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>
The intercontinental dictionary series (<a href="http://lingweb.eva.mpg.de/ids/">IDS</a>, <a 
href="http://lingulist.de/evobib/evobib.php?key=Key2007">Key &amp; Comrie 2007 eds.</a>) features 
lexical data for 233 world languages. IDS data were provided mostly by experts on the respective 
languages, although in some cases published written sources have been used. There are 1,310 entries 
to be filled for each language, though, of course, there are gaps in coverage for individual 
languages. The list of concepts
is inspired by <a href="http://lingulist.de/evobib/evobib.php?key=Buck1949">Buck (1949)</a>. Of all 233 languages in the IDS, 178 were automatically cleaned and included in CLiCs. 
</li>
<li>
The IDS list, in turn, provides the basis for the choice of meanings in the World Loanword Database 
(<a href="http://wold.livingsources.org/">WOLD</a>, <a 
href="http://lingulist.de/evobib/evobib.php?key=Wold2009">Haspelmath &amp; Tadmor 2009 eds.</a>).  
The principal aim of this source is to provide a basis for generalizations on the borrowability of 
items in different parts of the lexicon. The WOLD data consist of vocabularies of between 
1,000-2,000 items for 41 languages, with annotations about the borrowing history of particular items 
where applicable. WOLD data was coded by experts on the respective languages, in some cases also 
with the aid of extant sources. Of all 41 languages in WOLD, 33 are included in CLiCs. </li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.logosdictionary.org/index.php">Logos Dictionary</a> is a freely 
accessible multilingual online dictionary that is regularly updated online by a network of 
professional translators. It offers lexical data for more than 60 different languages. We manually 
extracted lexical data for 4 languages that were neither present in IDS nor in WOLD. 
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a style="color:black" name="cite">Citing CLiCs</a></h3>
<br>CLiCs can be cited as follows: 
<br><br>
<ul><li>
List, J.-M., A. Terhalle, M. Urban, and T. Mayer (2014). CLiCs — Database of Cross-Linguistic Colexifications.
Version 1.0 (Beta). URL: <a href="http://quanthistling.info">http://quanthistling.info/clics/"</a>.

<h3><a style="color:black" name="data2">Reliability of the Data</a></h3><br>
The structure of the data in CLiCs is a direct image of the structure of the data in IDS and WOLD 
and does not involve a
reanalysis of any sort on our behalf. However, it must be emphasized that the meaning associations 
reported in CLiCs are
recovered from sheer identity of form in different cells in the sources we have used, and do not 
necessarily rest on language-internal semantic analysis (see also the sections on <a href="faq.php#colexification">colexification</a> and <a href="faq.php#homonymy">homonymy</a>).  
Furthermore, we have no 
control over artifacts that <br><br> <ul><li>
    may have arisen in the process of data gathering themselves,</li><li>
    were created by mapping the 
predefined concepts onto the
actual languages, and </li><li>
    were introduced when cleaning parts of the data automatically in which the textual coding was not provided in a consistent way.</li></ul><br>
For these reasons, we strongly recommend to check the actual sources whenever a conceptual link that our database reports should be crucial for your arguments.
<br><br>
<h3><a style="color:black" name="data3">Statistics on CLiCs</a></h3>
<br>
CLiCs (Version 1.0) offers information on colexification in 215 different language varieties covering 50 different language families. 
All language varieties in our sample comprise a total of 290,760 words covering 1,285 different concepts. 
Using a strictly automatic procedure, we identified 45,282 cases of colexification that correspond to 16,043 different links between
the 1,285 concepts covered by our data.

<br>
<br>
<h3><a style="color:black" name="areal">Areal Bias in the Data</a></h3>
<br>
Coverage of the world’s languages in both IDS and WOLD is biased towards certain regions of the 
world. In the case of IDS, South American languages and languages of the Caucasus are 
overrepresented. In the case of WOLD, languages of Europe figure particularly prominently. Since
it is possible and even expectable that certain polysemies in the lexicon are frequent or even 
restricted to certain areas of the world, we advise researchers interested in cross-linguistic 
diversity to take appropriate measures to rule out unwarranted generalizations due to areal 
effects.
<br><br>
<h3><a style="color:black" name="homonymy">Homonymy</a></h3>
<br>
Conceptual links, which constitute our main interest in colexification, are clearly not the only 
possible reason why two concepts can be expressed by the same form in a given language. The most 
prominent among the others is homonymy, which is in very simple terms an <i>accidental similarity in 
form</i>, often arising from sound changes causing originally distinct lexical items to collapse 
phonologically. Such cases may lead to spurious links in the database (compare, for example, the 
links between the concepts "arm" and "poor" which are due to homonymy in some Germanic languages).  To deal with this issue in a consistent and generally 
applicable way (even if the history of the lexical items in question is not known) we recommend to 
employ a typological criterion to distinguish between homonymy and polysemy (see <a 
href="http://lingulist.de/evobib/evobib.php?key=Croft1990">Croft 1990</a>): for semantic connections 
to be accepted as genuine rather than accidental, the connection should be detectable in more than 
one language family. We should, however, point out that this criterion has been developed and 
originally applied by the aforementioned authors in the realm of polyfunctionality of grammatical markers, that 
is, items belonging to a paradigmatically relatively well-structured set of items with a manageable 
semantic range. When applied to lexical meanings, there is a danger that the criterion rules out a 
set of genuine, but simply rare, semantic associations. Still, we feel that our approach is 
justified, methodologically because it offers a simple and non-subjective decision criterion, and 
conceptually because our approach relies on cross-linguistic data in the first place.
<!--, and the more 
common a given association is cross-linguistically, themore faith we can have in it as a heuristic 
for diachronic semantic purposes, with the value of a very rare association being minor anyway.-->
