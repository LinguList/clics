<h3>What is CliCs?</h3>
<br>
CliPs is an online database of synchronic lexical associations 
("colexification") in currently 217 of the worlds' language varieties.  Large 
databases offering lexical information on the world’s languages is already readily 
available for research in different <a href="sources.php">online sources</a>.  
However, the information on tendencies of meaning associations available in these databases is 
not easily extractable from the sources themselves. This is why CliCs was 
created. It is designed to serve as a data source for work in lexical typology, 
diachronic semantics, and research in cognitive science that focuses on natural 
language semantics from the viewpoint of cross-linguistic diversity.  
Furthermore, CliCs can be used as a helpful tool to assess the plausibility of 
semantic connections between possible cognates in the establishment of genetic 
relations between languages.

<h3>What is <i>Colexification?</i></h3>
<br>
In the context of CliCs, we use the term colexification (coined to our 
knowledge by <a href="http://lingulist.de/evobib/evobib.php?key=Francois2008">François 2008</a>) to refer to the situation when two or more of the meanings 
in our lexical sources are covered in a language by the same lexical item. 
For instance, we would say that 
Russian <i>рука</i> colexifies "hand" and "arm", that is, concepts that are semantically related to each other.
Roughly spoken, colexification can correspond either to polysemy or semantic vagueness in lexical 
semantic analyses. Since we have not performed such analyses that would allow us to further discriminate between the two, 
we chose <i>colexification</i> as a label 
that deliberately does not make a commitment with regard to this distinction.  However, we have 
adopted measures to rule out effects of accidental homonymy (see [[homonymy]]).
