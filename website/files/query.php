<h3>Query CLICS</h3>
<br>
Currently, we offer two ways to query the data in CLICS interactively:
<br>
<br>
<ul><li>You can search for the number of attested links between two concepts by searching for <a href="direct.php">direct links</a>, or </li>
<li> You can search for all the links attested for a given concept by searching for <a href="all.php">all links</a>.</li>
</ul>
<br>
