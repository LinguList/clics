### Current plans for code to appear on this page

* code for computation of the whole network (preferably as json-like format in output)
* the computed full network
* code for computation of community clustering with help of igraph
* a csv-list containing node and community for all communities in the network
* a labelling for all communities (preferably the centroid or how that's called for each community)
* a csv-list with semantic fields of IDS and nodes belonging to the fields
